Add char to pixel in witch inside the pixel the closest value will be replaced
by the ascii values, for now it fells the modify of the pixel values by 3 chars
to be too much and can be easily seen in images with too low of resolution....

Other alternative would be to scan the whole image for pixels closest the the char value be the r or g or b of a single pixel.... and replace it
